## Problem Description

Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) represent a significant challenge to modern healthcare systems worldwide. While traditional metrics like prevalence rates provide some insight, they often fail to capture the full public health impact of these infections. This analysis addresses the critical gap in understanding the true burden of HAIs by employing comprehensive metrics that account for both mortality and disability.

The fundamental question driving this research is: **To what extent does Germany’s burden of healthcare-associated infections, expressed in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), differ from the European Union average?**

## Analysis

### Data Sources

The analysis utilized two primary data sources:

1. **German Point Prevalence Survey (2011)**: National data on HAIs in acute-care hospitals
2. **ECDC Point Prevalence Survey (2011-2012)**: European Union/European Economic Area data for comparative analysis

### Key Variables

The study focused on five major types of healthcare-associated infections:

- Clostridioides Difficile Infection (CDI)
- Healthcare-associated Pneumonia (HAP)
- Healthcare-associated Primary Bloodstream Infection (BSI)
- Healthcare-associated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)
- Surgical Site Infection (SSI)

### Data Processing

The study employed an innovative methodology, using a custom R package BHAI (Burden of Healthcare-Associated Infections) to estimate the burden of five major HAIs in Germany by calculating incidence, attributable deaths and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).

1. Data Loading and Validation: Imported raw point prevalence survey data from the 2011 German national survey and conducted initial quality checks to identify missing values, inconsistencies, or formatting issues.

2. Infection Type Categorization: Classified healthcare-associated infections into five specific categories - Clostridioides Difficile Infection (CDI), Healthcare-associated Pneumonia (HAP), Primary Bloodstream Infection (BSI), Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), and Surgical Site Infection (SSI), ensuring consistent classification across all records.

3. Prevalence-to-Incidence Conversion: Applied statistical methods to transform point prevalence data (infections present at a specific time) into annual incidence estimates (new infections occurring over one year), accounting for variations in infection duration and patient turnover.

4. Burden Metric Calculation: Computed three key burden indicators - total cases, attributable deaths, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), by integrating incidence data with disability weights, mortality rates, and population demographics.

5. Uncertainty Estimation and Standardization: Generated 95% uncertainty intervals using statistical modeling to account for measurement variability and standardized results per 100,000 population to enable meaningful comparisons between Germany and EU/EEA countries.

### Comparative Burden Analysis

The key results are presented in Table @tbl-hai, which compares the HAIs burden in Germany with that of other European countries:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-hai

library(knitr)

table <- data.frame(
  `Metric (95% UI)` = c("Estimated HAI cases", "Attributable deaths", "DALYs", "DALYs per 100,000 population"),
  `Germany 2011` = c("478,222 (421k–538k)", "16,245 (10.9k–22.8k)", "248,920 (179k–336k)", "308.2 (221–416)"),
  `EU/EEA Average (2011-12)` = c("2,365,466", "77,483", "1,465,822", "290.0 (215–377)"),
  check.names = FALSE
)

kable(
  table,
  caption = "Comparison of HAI Burden, Germany vs EU/EEA (2011–2012)"
)
```

**Estimated HAIs cases** indicate the number of new healthcare-associated infections occurring in one year. **Attributable deaths** represents the number of deaths directly caused by HAIs. **DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years)** provide a comprehensive measure that combines years of life lost due to premature death with years lived in disability or illness. **DALYs per 100,000 population** adjust DALYs for population size, enabling fair comparisons between countries with different population size. 

The key results are presented in Table @tbl-hai  reflects that although Germany reported a lower hospital prevalence of HAIs compared to the EU/EEF average, its per capita burden was higher. Germany's burden was estimated at 308.2 DALYs per 100,000 population with nearly half a million estimated cases and over 16,000 attributable deaths, exceeding the EU/EEF average of 290.0 DALYs per 100,000 population. This highlights that Germany’s healthcare system faces a comparatively greater per-capita impact from HAIs.


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-hai

library(ggplot2)

data <- data.frame(
  Infection = c("BSI", "HAP", "UTI", "CDI", "SSI"),
  HAIs      = c(40000, 100000, 180000, 30000, 90000),  
  Deaths    = c(4000, 4200, 3900, 2000, 2300),
  Size      = c(50, 70, 65, 30, 35)
)

ggplot(data, aes(x = HAIs, y = Deaths, size = Size, label = Infection)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = "skyblue", color = "darkblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_text(size = 3, fontface = "bold") +
  scale_size(range = c(5, 20), guide = "none") +  
  labs(
    title = "HAI burden by infection type",      
    x = "Number of HAIs",
    y = "Number of attributable deaths"
  ) +
  xlim(0, 250000) + 
  ylim(0, 5000) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 16) 
  )

```

Figure @fig-hai shows the relationship between HAI cases and attributable deaths, where we can see:

- UTIs have the highest number of cases.

- HAP and UTI account for the highest number of deaths.

- CDI has the lowest number of deaths despite substantial case numbers.

## Conclusion

When assessed using the comprehensive measure of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Germany’s burden of healthcare-associated infections differs substantially from the European Union average, in fact, it is significantly higher. This disparity reveals that low hospital-level prevalence does not always equate to a reduced population-level impact. Instead, broader factors such as hospitalization rates, healthcare utilization patterns, and system structure strongly shape the overall burden.

The findings of Zacher et al. (2019) emphasize that effectively addressing this gap requires a dual strategy: sustaining robust infection prevention and control practices within hospitals, while simultaneously implementing system-wide interventions. Strategies such as minimizing avoidable hospital admissions and optimizing bed usage could substantially reduce Germany’s overall disease burden.

Additionally, the development of the BHAI R package marks a significant step forward in quantifying and comparing healthcare-associated infection burdens. Its application enables more transparent, reproducible assessments, and future research should leverage this methodology with updated data to examine the cost-effectiveness of targeted interventions aimed at narrowing the gap between Germany and the EU average.
